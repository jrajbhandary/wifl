## General Goals
My goal is to use the WIFL database to learn more about analyzing big datasets and to be able to use github for data reproducibility 

### Reading Data In

```{r read-one-snppit}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

wifl <- read_csv ("data/WIFL_Metadata.csv")
View(wifl)
```
Data Transformation
```{r}
eben <- filter(wifl, Collector == "Eben Paxton")
arrange(wifl, Field_Number)
wifl2 <- wifl%>%
  select(Field_Number, Near_Town, Lat, Lon, Stage, State)
```

Relational Data
```{r}
panel1 <- read_tsv("data/panel1_all_two_col.txt", col_names = T)
panel2 <- read_tsv("data/panel2_all_two_col.txt", col_names = T)
View(panel2)
wiflp1 <- wifl2 %>%
  left_join(., panel1, by = c("Field_Number" = "Sample_ID"))
View(wiflp1)

wiflnew <- wifl2[which(!is.na(wifl2$Lat)),]
View(wiflnew)
dim(wiflp1)
dim(wiflnew)

```

```{r}
library(ggmap)
get_googlemap(center=c(mean(wiflnew$Lon), mean(wiflnew$Lat)), 
              zoom=10) %>%
  ggmap()+
  geom_point(wiflnew, mapping=aes(Lon, Lat), color = "red")
```
